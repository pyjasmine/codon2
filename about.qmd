# Hello!

my name is Jasmine. I come from a background of Life Sciences, with an undergraduate degree in Pharmacology and a Masters of Research in Neuroscience. I have worked in the Biotech industry for a couple of years working with induced Pluripotent Stem Cells R&D. I gained an interest in data analysis from working on an collaborative RNA sequencing project, I was curious as to how so much data could be analysed quite fast and presented in visualisations that helped us make decisions reguarding cells.
From there I went on to do a summer course in Data Science, learning Python coding, data analysis, and machine learning.
